I had a lot of trouble with this assignment. Still, I think I've learned
a good bit since Monday. I'm trying not to be hard on myself. There are a few
things that seem to not be clicking in terms of understanding logic and syntax.
I did my best to not look up any tic tac toe games, and I really went off my 
intuition of what would be right to use. I did look up some stuff regarding the .onclick function, which looks different than what we've done. I'd much rather be showing you exactly where I'm at then researching how to code for this game and applying logic I didnt get to begin with.
